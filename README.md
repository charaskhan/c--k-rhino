Rhino Web, often associated with Rhino Anywhere, is a framework that enables the streaming of 3D models created in Rhino to web platforms. This allows users to interact with and manipulate Rhino models directly in a web browser, without requiring the Rhino software to be installed on the clientâ€™s machine.
